# WWDC2022

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-accepted-green)

This is my accepted WWDC 2022 project. This is a game focused on teaching how our immune system react in an attack and some of the different immune cells in our defense.


### Running
 There are 2 project folders in this repository, one with a [Xcode Playground](https://github.com/LuizGuerra/WWDC2022/tree/main/WWDC2022.playground) and the other one is a regular [Swift PM Project](https://github.com/LuizGuerra/WWDC2022/tree/main/The%20White%20Cell%E2%80%99s%20adventure.swiftpm). They are the same game.
